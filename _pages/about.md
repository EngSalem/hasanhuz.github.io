* I am pursuing Bachelor’s Degree in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). In my sophomore year, I joined [Apex Data and Knowledge Mangement Lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/) as a research assistant, advised by [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu) and [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Jun Wang](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/blog/) in [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).
